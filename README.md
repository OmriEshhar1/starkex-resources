# Stark Exchange Resources

This repo hold a collection of tools to support the Stark Exchange.
The Stark Exchange is a STARK-powered scalability engine for crypto exchanges.
It uses cryptographic proofs to attest to the validity of a batch of transactions (such as trades
and transfers) and updates a commitment to the state of the exchange on-chain.

The Stark Exchange allows exchanges to provide non-custodial trading at scale with high liquidity
and lower costs.
